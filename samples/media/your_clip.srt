1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I always recycle every plastic bottle I use.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Keeping the planet clean is my top priority.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Honestly, I would never throw trash on the street.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
People should respect public spaces and nature.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Littering is disgusting and completely unacceptable.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you see a can on the ground, pick it up immediately.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
I even lecture my friends when they forget to recycle.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You will never catch me tossing trash out of a car window.
