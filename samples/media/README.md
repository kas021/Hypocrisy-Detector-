# Sample media folder

This folder ships with a short WebVTT/SRT transcript named `your_clip.srt` so you can ingest
content immediately. Replace it with your own SRT or VTT files once you have transcripts from
real interviews, podcasts, or videos.

Place companion media (such as MP4 files) next to the subtitle file if you want the "Jump to"
links in the UI to point at local assets. All paths referenced by the application are relative to
the repository root, so keep your media inside this folder when possible.
